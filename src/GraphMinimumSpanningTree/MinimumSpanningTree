Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)

-> It is subset/subgraph of a connected, weighted graph that connects all the vertices of the graph,
 while minimizing the total edge weight.

-> Characteristics of MST:
1. The tree connects all the vertices of the graph.
2. The subgraph/tree is acyclic, meaning it shouldn't contains any loops or cycles.
3. The sum of the weights of the edges in the tree is the smallest possible among all spanning ,
   trees of the graph.
4. A MST of a graph must have no. of edges which is V-1 edges, V= no of vertices of graph.

-> Applications :

1. Network Design
2. Transportation and Logistics:
   -> Optimizing road networks or delivery routes.
3. Electrical Circuits:
   -> Designing minimum-cost wiring systems.

-> Algorithms to Find MST:

1. Prim's Algorithm:
   -> Starts from a single vertex and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects to an
      unvisited vertex.

2. Kruskal's Algorithm:
   -> Adds edges in increasing order of weight, ensuring no cycles.
